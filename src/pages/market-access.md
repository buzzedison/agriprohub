Small and medium-sized agribusinesses (A-SMEs) are a potential driver of inclusive agriculture-led economic growth, but they face constraints â€“ including inadequate financing, lack of market information, lack of market orientation, limited market linkages and limited connections to quality service providers that can help them achieve sustainable and inclusive business growth.

## That is where we come in. 

### 
We create systems linking smallholder farmers and other agribusinesses to local and global markets. Our goal is to eliminate, reduce or bridge the gap between farmers and markets.
