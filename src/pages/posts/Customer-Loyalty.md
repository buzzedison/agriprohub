[Guzakuza](http://agriprohub.com/www.guzakuza.org) in partnership with [AgriPro](https://www.agriprohub.com/) bring you Ignite 2019. It is getting better, bigger and with a more directed and focused approach. Ignite 2019 with the theme ‘inspire action’ will motivate participants to take action in various aspects of their Agribusinesses.

From the classroom to the farm to the board room, women should be at the fore front of agricultural development, paving the way for a brighter future and ensuring food security. Young women face so many barriers to entry in their quest to venture into agribusiness. Some of those barriers include technical know-how, market access limitations, limited access to funding, cultural pressure and lack of a structured mentorship support system. It is for this reason that Guzakuza started Ignite, an African Women in Agribusiness Programme.

**Ignite 2017 and 2018 provided opportunities and served as a platform for participants to be educated,nurtured and empowered to build sustainable food businesses, spend some quality time on their business models devoid of any form of distraction and improve their personal development.**

## IGNITE FOR CHANGE- RESIDENTIAL TRAINING

We at Ignite believe that one of the best ways to learn, is to stay away from all forms of distraction. As such, our participants will be staying in a residence for six weeks, where they get the space and time to develop exponentially. Participants get the rare opportunity to retreat, learn, relax, collaborate, and spend ample time on their businesses.

### IGNITE WITHIN- ONLINE

We see a burning desire in most of our participants to make a dent in the society. This desire is illuminated and guided by our structured online assessment program seeking to help participants discover themselves, gifts, talents, as well as hidden biases and beliefs that could be getting in the way of succeeding in business.\
Our online support puts the mirror right in front of the participants to assess self and discover greatness.

### REACH TO IGNITE- INTERNSHIPS

We provide tailor made work experience embedded into the program. Our internship can be likened to an apprenticeship where participants go through a four-week on-the-job training with our partner organizations’.
