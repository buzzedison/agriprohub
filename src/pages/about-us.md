### **Experience and In-depth Understanding of Agribusiness**

We understand the unique challenges that agricultural companies face. Our first-hand experience has included working on our own 20 acre farm, dealing with suppliers, dealers, service providers, and trade associations of livestock feed ingredients, vegetable and field seeds, fertilizer and soil amendments, farm equipment, horticultural supplies, irrigation, finance, specialized computer software, and transportation. Clients in agricultural production have included producers of fresh fruits and vegetables, processed foods, livestock and poultry, dairy products.
